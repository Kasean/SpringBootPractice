# Spring Boot Homework Tasks
---
## Task 1 - Hello-world application
**Cost**: 15 points
- Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) to create a basic Spring Boot application with minimal dependencies.
- Implement the `CommandLineRunner` interface in your application.
- Output the message `hello world` to the console.
- Run the application and verify that the message is displayed when the Spring context starts.
---
## Task 2 - CRUD REST application
**Cost**: 20 points
- Choose a simple entity (e.g., `Customer`, `Product`) with a few attributes (e.g., `id`, `name`, etc.).
- Use `Spring Data JPA` for repository management, but avoid the use of Spring Data REST Starter.
- Create a REST controller with endpoints supporting Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the entity.
- Test the endpoints using tools such as `Postman` or `cURL`.
---
## Task 3 - CRUD application: security
**Cost**: 20 points
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth2 and JWT tokens.
- Configure a security setup that includes OAuth2 for user authentication.
- Issue JWT tokens for authenticated users, and ensure incoming requests validate these tokens.
- Restrict access to endpoints based on user roles (e.g., `USER`, `ADMIN`).
---
## Task 4 (Optional) - CRUD application: externalized configuration
**Cost**: 10 points
- Use Spring Profiles to support multiple environments like `local`, `dev`, `stg`, `prod`.
- Create separate configuration files (`application-{profile}.yml`) for each environment with different database properties.
- Enable the correct profile during runtime (e.g., by setting `spring.profiles.active`), and ensure corresponding configuration is applied.
---
## Task 5 (Optional) - CRUD application: data migrating
**Cost**: 10 points
- Select a tool like `Flyway` or `Liquibase` for managing database schema migrations.
- Provide migration scripts or files to create and update the database schema as needed.
- Configure the migration tool to run automatically during the application startup.
---
## Task 6 - Actuator
**Cost**: 15 points
- Enable Spring Boot Actuator within your application for monitoring and management purposes.
- Implement custom health indicators to monitor application-specific health metrics.
- Add custom metrics for Prometheus or other tools to observe the application's behavior.
---
## Task 7 (Optional) - CRUD application: testing
**Cost**: 10 points
- Configure an in-memory database (e.g., H2) for test purposes.
- Implement repository tests to validate data access logic.
- Write unit tests for service-level logic.
- Test `RestController` endpoints using `MockMvc`.
- Perform integration tests to validate end-to-end behavior in the application.

## Point Calculation
- **Mandatory tasks sum**: 70 points (Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 6)
- **Optional tasks sum**: 30 points (Tasks 4, 5, and 7)
- **Total possible points**: 100 points
